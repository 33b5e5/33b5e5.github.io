I recently picked up a [Baofeng BF-F8HP from Amazon](http://a.co/2Bi5GBK). It's an interesting little handheld radio made by Baofeng in Beijing. It can transmit or receive on 136-174 MHz (VHF) and 400-520 MHz (UHF) bands at 8 watts, and receive on 65-108 MHz (FM).

Interestingly it also has the ability to transmit "touch tones" (DTMF) using the keypad. This is likely how the air-raid sirens were hacked in Dallas:

The hack is reminiscent of Captain Crunch and an older era of analog hacking, but is still relevant because we rely on analog RF signals for emergency communications and infrastructure.

Despite its widespread availability, the BF-F8HP is technically out of spec in the US, and certain uses of this radio may be against FCC regulations (including out-of-spec or over-powered transmissions, not to mention hacking air-raid sirens).

I'm using it to explore RF transmissions, and to expirement with the intersection of modern tech and older analog RF tech.
