Gigabit fiber. :)

I replaced the standard CenturyLink router with this guy:

I'm pleased with it so far especially for the price ($95 on Amazon). It's kicking ass and outperforming CenturyLink's stock router.

This is from my Macbook Air plugged into the EdgeRouter. Now I need to find a good 11ac wireless router...
