I recently picked up Baofeng BF-F8HP. It's an interesting handheld radio made by Baofeng in Beijing. It can transmit or receive on 136-174 MHz (VHF) and 400-520 MHz (UHF) bands at 8 watts, and receive on 65.0-108.0 MHz (FM).

Interestingly it also has the ability to transmit "touch tones" (DTMF) using the keypad. This is likely how the air-raid sirens were hacked in Dallas:

[Hacking blamed for emergency sirens blaring across Dallas early Saturday](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas/2017/04/08/emergency-sirens-blare-across-dallas-county-despite-clear-weather)  

The hack is reminiscent of Captain Crunch and an older era of analog hacking, but is still relevant because we rely on analog RF signals for emergency communications and infrastrucure.

Despite its widespread availability, the BF-F8HP is technically out of spec in the US, and certain uses (mainly, out-of-spec or over-powered transmissions) from this radio may be against FCC regulations.
